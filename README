Command Line Instructions
Output and log files will be in the same path than the input file.

Options:
-help:                 List options.
-version:              Get current version.
-info:                 Outputs info about input file in log file
-inputtype <string>:   Input type of delay/cut values. (default millseconds
                       when not specified) [milliseconds, seconds, videoframes]
-fps <float|rational>: Specify frame rate.
                       Needed when inputtype is set to frames.
-fixcrc <string>:      Specify action to take in the case of crc errors
                       [ignore, skip, fix, silence]
-startdelay <integer>: Specify the needed frames added at the beginning of the file
-delay <integer>:      Alias for -startdelay
-enddelay <integer>:   Specify the needed frames added at the end of the file
-same:                 file length will be the same after adding delay
-auto:                 detect start delay in filename (assuming DVD2AVI style)
-startcut <integer>:   Specify cut start point
-endcut <integer>:     Specify cut end point
-o <string>:           specify output file
-i <string>:           specify inputfile

Examples:
Get info: Log file will be myfile_log.txt
    delaycut -info -i myfile.ac3

Adds 100 msec of silence at the begining. File lenght will be the same
    delaycut -startdelay 100 -same -i myfile.ac3

Adds 100 msec of silence at the begining. File lenght will be 100 msecs more
    delaycut -startdelay 100 -i myfile.ac3

Cuts start at 10.32 sec and ends at 15.20 sec.
    delaycut -inputtype seconds -startcut 10.32 -endcut 15.20 -i myfile.ac3

Cuts start at 10320 msec and ends at 15200 msec. Delay correction of 100 msec.
    delaycut -delay 100 -startcut 10320 -endcut 15200 -i myfile.ac3

Automatic delay correction based on the filename (-500 msec in this case)
    delaycut -auto "myfile DELAY -500ms.ac3"
